# Task3: Replace the legacy chunk
For the fluctuated available network bandwidth, it could be a chance, the Abr can replace a previously downloaded low-quality chunk. In this task, we provide the **best speed** ABR to download the chunks, but after each chunk is downloaded, you can use CustomReplace.py to check whether there is a chunk that can be replaced with the available bandwidth. You need to submit CustomReplace.py in this task.
